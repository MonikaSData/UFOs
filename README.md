    - Date
    - City
    - State
    - Country
    - Shape

Each filter has a placeholder value to provide the user a hint what to enter. Once the user makes their selection, they press enter to view the results.
Filters that are not applicable can be left empty.

## Summary
The current filters on the webpage offers good functionality for the users by giving them the ability to interact with the data; however, there are ways to improve the functionality. 

- *Examples:*
    - Adding restrictions on the data types entered in the filters (date only for date filter)
    - To ensure that user only chooses filters included in the dataset incorporate drop-downs instead of text fields.
